# mimalloc-pprof

A fork of [microsoft/mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) that adds
**pprof-compatible sampled heap profiling** — including on **native Windows**, where no
drop-in allocator offers pprof heap profiles today (gperftools' heap profiler doesn't build
there, jemalloc's `prof` is POSIX-only, and memray/bytehound/heaptrack/heapprofd are
Linux-first).

Profiles are analyzed with the standard [google/pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof)
tooling (`pprof -http`, flamegraphs, `-base` diffs).

> **Status: design phase.** The architecture and phased implementation plan live in
> [issue #2](https://github.com/zackees/mimalloc-pprof/issues/2). Nothing is implemented yet.

## What this adds on top of mimalloc

- Byte-interval **allocation sampling** (tcmalloc-style, ~512 KiB default rate) with
  near-zero cost when disabled and bounded cost when enabled. Allocator-side design based on
  Datadog's draft [microsoft/mimalloc#1266](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc/pull/1266).
  Profiler-internal memory (records, the stack intern table, dump buffers) is bounded and
  never taken from the app's own allocations — see the Bounds table and failure policy in
  `include/mimalloc/profile.h`'s top-of-file comment; under memory pressure samples are
  dropped (counted in `mi_prof_stats_t.dropped_samples`), the app never fails an allocation
  because of the profiler.
- **Stack capture** per sample: `RtlCaptureStackBackTrace` on Windows, frame-pointer /
  libunwind on Linux and macOS.
- **Heap profile dumps** in the gperftools `heap_v2` text format (accepted by pprof), with
  the module map (`MAPPED_LIBRARIES`) emitted per-OS so pprof can symbolize offline.
  A binary `profile.proto` encoder and optional dbghelp runtime symbolization come later.
- **Rust crate** (`rust/` workspace): `mimalloc-pprof` — a `#[global_allocator]` plus a
  safe profiling-control API, with the raw FFI bindings available as `mimalloc_pprof::sys`.
  It builds against a single vendored, amalgamated C translation unit
  (`rust/mimalloc-pprof/vendor/mimalloc-pprof-amalgamated.c`) regenerated from `src/`/`include/`
  by the `xtask` dev-tool (`cargo run -p xtask -- amalgamate-c` / `amalgamate-h` / `check`).

## Repository layout

```
/                      # the C library — a real fork of microsoft/mimalloc (shared git history)
├── include/ src/ test/ CMakeLists.txt
├── readme-upstream.md # upstream's readme.md (renamed so this file can exist on Windows)
└── rust/              # cargo workspace
    ├── mimalloc-pprof/    # the crate: #[global_allocator] + safe profiling API + raw `sys` bindings
    │   └── vendor/        # generated: single-file C amalgamation compiled by build.rs
    └── xtask/             # dev-tool: regenerates vendor/ from src/ + include/
```

This is a **mono-repo on purpose**: the profiling feature spans the C core (sampling hooks)
and the Rust API (control/dump), so they change together in atomic commits, and one CI
matrix proves Windows + cross-compilation on every change.

## Relationship to upstream

- The repo root **is** mimalloc — full upstream git history, based on the v2 line
  (upstream `main`, v2.4.1+). The v3 line (`dev3`) is a later milestone.
- Syncing: `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` (the `rust/` directory never
  conflicts). Upstream edits to `readme.md` follow the rename via git rename detection.
- Upstreaming: C-only commits are cherry-picked onto ephemeral `pr/*` branches cut from
  `upstream/main` and submitted to microsoft/mimalloc. Keeping C-core and `rust/` changes
  in separate commits is a repo rule for exactly this reason.

## Rust integration guide (profiling builds)

The profiler records **raw program counters** at sample time; function names and types
appear only when pprof symbolizes them offline against your binary. Because the
`GlobalAlloc` shim (`__rust_alloc`) is shared, untyped code, your object types come from
the **monomorphized caller frames** — `RawVec<MyStruct>::grow_amortized`,
`Box::new::<MyStruct>`, `Arc<MyStruct>::new`, and so on. The capture skips the allocator's
own frames, so stored frames start at your call site. Two build settings make those caller
frames actually recoverable in release builds:

```toml
# Cargo.toml — keep line tables so pprof can expand inlined monomorphized frames
[profile.release]
debug = "line-tables-only"   # Cargo >= 1.71 ("debug = 1" also works)
strip = false                # pprof symbolizes from the on-disk binary
```

```toml
# .cargo/config.toml — reliable stack capture on Linux/macOS (frame-pointer walker).
# Not needed on Windows x64, where RtlCaptureStackBackTrace uses unwind tables.
[build]
rustflags = ["-Cforce-frame-pointers=yes"]
```

Notes:

- Frame pointers cost ≲1% on x86-64/aarch64 and are becoming the distro default anyway
  (Fedora, Ubuntu 24.04+ build system packages with them).
- Without line tables, inlined frames collapse into their caller: profiles still work, but
  a `Vec<T>::push` that was inlined into your function won't appear as its own frame.
- On MSVC targets, keep the `.pdb` produced alongside the binary; `llvm-symbolizer` (which
  pprof can use) reads PE/PDB natively. Runtime dbghelp symbolization is a planned option
  (issue #2, Phase 5) that removes the PDB-at-analysis-time requirement entirely.

## Building

For a fast Windows-hosted Linux C/Rust development loop using Docker named
volumes, see [docs/dev-loop.md](docs/dev-loop.md).

The C library builds exactly like upstream mimalloc:

```
cmake -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build
```

See `readme-upstream.md` for the full upstream documentation. The Rust workspace and the
soldr-based cross-compile CI are specified in issue #2.
