# CI gates

*Part of the [mimalloc-pprof](../README.md) documentation.*

Every gate below runs on each PR and is a **hard failure**. Where a gate can have a
*positive control* — a deliberately broken input it must catch — it has one, because a
gate that has never been observed to fire proves nothing.

That is not a hypothetical standard. **Seven gates in this repository were found to be
verifying nothing**, each discovered by asking "has this ever actually failed?":

- the arm64 instruction scanner matched nothing at all and reported "clean"
- the memory-gate's leak control existed but was never invoked
- the ASan job's branch filter excluded every branch we work on
- the cross-build pipeline discarded its own diagnostics
- `MI_TRACK_ASAN` silently self-disabled when its header was missing
- `MI_GUARDED` was documented as default-on in debug builds and had **never once** been
  enabled — two independent dead CMake constructs
- the fuzz job's "did ASan report this?" check matched libFuzzer's own boilerplate line
  *"Combine libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer…"* — so the string proving ASan worked was
  libFuzzer saying it was not in use

| Gate | What it catches | Positive control |
|---|---|---|
| **memory-gate** (`ci/memory_gate.py`) | peak memory or thread-count regressions vs a committed per-platform baseline | builds a copy with an injected leak; the gate must fail — verified at +212% / +98% / +27% on linux/windows/macos |
| **isa-baseline** (`ci/check_isa_baseline.py`) | binaries containing instructions above the CPU baseline, which SIGILL on older hardware | builds with `MI_OPT_ARCH=ON`; the scanner must fire. The parser also self-tests against x86 and arm64 fixtures on every run |
| **ctest matrix** | correctness on ubuntu / windows-MSVC / windows-MinGW / macos, `MI_PPROF` on and off, `MI_DEBUG_FULL`, and shared-library builds on all three of ubuntu, MSVC and MinGW | — |
| **ctest-guarded** | the `MI_GUARDED` guard-page path, run twice: at the default sample rate and again with `MIMALLOC_GUARDED_SAMPLE_RATE=1` so every eligible allocation is guarded | configure step greps the resolved compiler defines for `MI_GUARDED=1`, since the original bug was the flag never reaching the compiler |
| **asan** | use-after-free, overflow and leaks under AddressSanitizer | — |
| **fuzz** (`test/fuzz/`) | crashes from structured random allocator-API sequences, with ASan as the oracle | builds with a planted use-after-free and requires an anchored `(ERROR\|SUMMARY): AddressSanitizer:` report naming it |
| **amalgamation-drift** | a C change that never reached the vendored copy the Rust crate compiles — which broke `main` twice before this gate existed | — |
| **python-lint** | the gate scripts themselves — `ruff` + `pyright --strict` | — |
| **zero-tracking** | correctness and footprint of `mi_option_purge_zeroes`, reported as paired interleaved A/B medians with the within-arm spread alongside | — |

Three details worth stating, because each was an assumption that measurement overturned:

- **Peak memory is not a low-variance signal.** Repeated runs of the same unchanged
  binary span 6–12% on CI runners. The memory gate therefore compares the **minimum of
  four runs** and prints the observed spread every time, warning if it ever approaches
  the tolerance. A gate that flakes gets ignored, and an ignored gate is worse than none.
- **The gate scripts are gating code.** Several of the silent failures above were Python
  or YAML bugs rather than C bugs — the arm64 instruction scanner matched nothing at all
  and reported "clean". Hence `pyright --strict` over `ci/`, with the result schema
  declared rather than indexed by hope.
- **Match report headers, not prose.** The fuzz control's `grep -qiE "AddressSanitizer"`
  was satisfied by libFuzzer's advice *to use* AddressSanitizer. Assertions about tool
  output should anchor on that tool's actual report format (`^(==[0-9]+==)?(ERROR|SUMMARY):`),
  never on a keyword that can appear in an explanatory sentence.
